# Shelf

![worker](https://github.com/fourjuaneight/shelf/actions/workflows/worker.yml/badge.svg)<br/>

I keep a [digital bookshelf](https://cleverlaziness.com/shelf/) of my favorite media items. This worker is how I add, update, and query that data.

All code is self-documented. Aside from the specific names of bases and tables in Airtable, everything is easily portable and ready to fork. You'll just need to provide your environment variables.
